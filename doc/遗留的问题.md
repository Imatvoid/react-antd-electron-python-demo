不选择同时运行会报错?

## zeromq zerprpc
make: g++: Command not found
安装g++

linux 下装zerpmq会有一点小问题.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/zeromq
我是先按照官网的说明先装的zeromq(npm),然后装的zerorpc

https://github.com/JustinTulloss/zeromq.node/issues/602
npm rebuild zeromq --runtime=electron --target=1.4.5
npm install electron-rebuild && ./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild
https://www.npmjs.com/package/zerorpc


## TypeError: zmq.zmqVersion is not a function
Oh I see, I thought you were trying to access the zmqVersion and that's why it's throwing.

If I recall correctly create-react-app uses webpack to bundle all dependencies. Since zeromq is a native module (uses C++ code) it cannot be packaged via webpack. Webpack should have a option to ignore this module.

Thinking about this again, I actually don't think it's even possible to run native modules in the browser. They are intended to be used in a Node.js environment like a server or an Electron app.
